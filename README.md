##Description of run_analysis.R script

In essence, the script creates a function that executes the following steps:
- Imports all the data needed for the analysis
- Merges the test and training data sets in order to create a single data set
- Extracts the average and standard deviation data from the data set created in the step before.
- Labels appropiately the variables
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Returns a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
